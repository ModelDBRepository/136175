Note: As most biologically detailed neuron models, this model is under
continuous development, and modifications of it (both in GENESIS and
NEURON) have already been used for follow-up publications by Dieter
Jaeger's and Volker Steuber's teams (Rin et al. and Luthman et al.,
submitted). Please contact us (djaeger@emory.edu and
v.steuber@herts.ac.uk) for information about the latest
updates. Moreover, we hope that future updates by others will be made
available on ModelDB and we would appreciate hearing about them. We
would also like to hear about any new experimental data that could be
used to improve the model.

Usage: Download and extract the archive, and create a subdirectory called data
in the directory that contains all simulation files. There are three
separate main scripts to simulate current injection, voltage clamp and
synaptic input. These three types of simulations are run with:

genesis cn_cip_main.g
genesis cn_vclamp_main.g
genesis cn_syn_main.g
